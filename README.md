# first-project
  In this project I have manipulated the "season18-19.csv" dataset and got some insights about the first half of the English Premier League's season 2018/2019.
  This is just a project I did to put into practice what I have learned in the field of data science, related to my field of interest.
  The source of the data is "https://datahub.io/core/english-premier-league" .
